While this is meant to be primarily an online tutorial, we find it important to remind people that we should always strive to work in and create a positive environment in which everyone is welcome.

We are dedicated to providing a supportive environment for all people. We do not tolerate harassment or abuse by or toward anyone participating in this program at any level.  Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. If you have concerns about someone's behavior, either a mentor or student in the course, please contact one of the leaders of the program. Most times the conflict can be resolved with a diaglogue between all parties. In extreme cases, drastic actions may need to be taken, but conflict resolution on the person to perioson level should be attempted first. 

* Intro 2 Astro interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

This workshop stands behind the principle open inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and constructive disagreement in research and education. We model this principle on the Heterodox Academy.
